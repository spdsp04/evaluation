Assignment: Sentiment Classification

Tokenization, Stop word Removal, Stemming, Lemmatization, steps have been covered correctly . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 

Data has been split to train and validation sets
TfidfVectorizer method has been loaded and fit on the train data using proper hyperparameters
TFidfVectorizer method has been used to transform the train data
TFidfVectorizer method has been used to transform the validation data
The sentiments have been label encoded

One of the conventional models listed in the stub notebook has been built

Model's hyperparameters have been properly tuned to obtain the best performance

Data set is properly converted from a sparse matrix to a sparse tensor

FCFNN has been built upon the tf-idf data correctly

Proper hyperparameter tuning has been done using batch_size, epochs, etc.
Sufficient steps for taking care of overfitting and underfitting have been taken

Measures like accuracy, precision, recall, etc. have been used to evalute the conventional ML model
Necessary graphs have been built to identify the best model parameters for the conventional ML model

Measures like accuracy,etc. have been used to evalute the deep learning model
Necessary graphs have been built to identify the best model parameters for the deep learning model
