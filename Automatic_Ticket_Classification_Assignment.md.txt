# Automatic_Ticket_Classification Assignment

1.	Data Understanding, Preparation, and EDA

1.1	Data Reading/Data Understanding

You have imported the .json data and created the dataframe from it. The learner also has to read the data and make the initial analysis out of it.


1.2	Data Cleaning

You have done data cleaning operations like filtering text, removing missing values &amp; renaming column headers.

1.3	Data Preprocessing

You have done Data pre-processing steps are done using statistical operations like Lemmatization & POS tagging.

1.4	Data Visualization

You have done the visualization steps for finding the word count distribution & n-gram distribution.

2.	Feature Extraction and Topic Modelling

2.1	Feature Extraction

You have extracted features from the data using Td-Idf.

2.2	Topic Modelling

You have assigned topic names are to each complaint

Features are extracted from the data using Td-Idf.

Topic names are assigned to each complaint

all this show good effort. good work . . .  .


3.	Model Building and Evaluation

3.1	Model Building

You have created multiple models using supervised learning

3.2	Model inference

You have applied the best model to predict a custom text to see its performance.


4.	Coding Guidelines

4.1	Coding Guidelines - Good Practices

Code readability is good with appropriate indentations

Comments are used throughout the code to explain commands/steps. Appropriate naming of variables has been done (all model names)

Concise code and appropriate commands are used instead of lengthy ones
