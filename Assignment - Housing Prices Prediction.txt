The histogram has been plotted with SalePrice . . . . . . ..  

The correlations are presented in a table in descending/ascending order of correlation . . . . . .

Good/insightful visualization has been made . . . . . .  ..

Dummy variables has been created for categorical features
70-30 train-test split has been done
The numerical columns were scaled using StandardScaler()

The optimum alpha was achieved using LassoCV
Optimum depth was achieved using RegressionTrees
The top 20 features were selected for training with optimum value of k

All the models' RMSEs were displayed for both training and validation sets
