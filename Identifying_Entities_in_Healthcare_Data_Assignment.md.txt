# Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data Assignment 

the sentences has been formed correctly and printed the 5 sentences that have been formed

You have counted the number of sentences in train and test data
the number of sentences in train/test dataset is equal to the number of lines of labels in train/test dataset

You have extracted all the tokens with NOUN and PROPN as their PoS tags with their frequency.
You have printed the top 25 most common tokens with NOUN and PROPN as their PoS tags.

You have defined features with PoS tag as one of the features
You have used the previous word to define the features

You have correctly marked the beginning and the end words in a sentence

You have correctly defined the function/steps to get the features' value of each token in a sentence
You have correctly defined the function/steps to get the list of a given preprocessed label line that learner has created earlier

You have defined the features' values for each sentences as input variable for CRF model in test & train dataset.
You have defined the labels as the target variable for test & train dataset.

You have built the CRF model . . . . . . . . . . . . ..  

You have predicted the labels of each sentences in test dataset

You have f1 score >85% . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

You have build the code or logic to get all the predicted treatment (T) labels corresponding to each disease (D) label in the test dataset
You have predicted the treatment for the disease name 'hereditary retinoblastoma' as 'radiotherapy'.
