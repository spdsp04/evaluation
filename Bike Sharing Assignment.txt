Bike Sharing Assignment

You have done good analysis and stated clear observations. . . .. . . . . . 

the variable has been assigned string values correctly . . . . . . .. . . . . . . . . 

all variables have been dummified correctly and the original columns have been dropped. 

Random sampling has been done correctly and the test and train datasets have been created successfully

Scaled all the predictor features correctly 
You have done feature scaling after test-train split and not before it

RFE is used to eliminate many of the features . .  . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . . . 

Multicollinearity is measured using VIF and considered while building the model . . .. . . 

Final model is not having more than 10 variables 
The adjusted R-squared on the train dataset is on par with the ideal solution

A histogram is plotted to check the normality of error terms

Test set has been scaled and predictions have been made on the test set
Only 'transform' has been used to scale the test set and not 'fit_transform'
The r2_score of the test set is on par with the r2_score of the ideal solution

The difference in the evaluation metric (R^2/adjusted R^2) of training and test dataset is not very large

Code readability is good with appropriate indentations
Comments are used throughout the code to explain commands/steps. Appropriate naming of variables has been done (all model names)
Concise code and appropriate commands are used instead of lengthy ones

the answer is correct, concise, and to the point. . . . . .  .. . . .. . . . . . . . ..
