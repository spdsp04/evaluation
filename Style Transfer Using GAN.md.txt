You have Imported the images & created two separate datasets.
You have input shape for image equal to (256, 256). 


You have created a function to process train & test dataset with normalisation in range (-1,1).
You have applied the random flipping for the dataset.
You have AUTOTUNED while preprocessing the dataset.



You have successfully used Instance Normalization.
all layers (conv2d + instance norm + leaky relu) are used. 
all layers (conv2DTranspose + Instance Norm + leaky relu + drop out) are present. 
downsampling function is used for reducing the image dimensions to size (1,1,512). 
upsampling function is used for increasing the image dimensions to (256,256,1).
You have - stored skip connections for each downsampling layer - established skip connections for connecting upsampling and downsampling layers through concat layer.
You have used downsampling function to reduce image dimensions to a patch of (6,6,1). 


You have created all the loss functions successfully.
You have created cycle loss and identity loss function successfully


You have set the Adam optimizer successfully.
You have initialized the checkpoint successfully.
You have defined the function for training step. The learner should have translated the images using both Generator & discriminator to calculate the loss functions. Once done the learner should apply back the gradients to the optimizer. 


the code is decently readable and well-commented.


appropriate libraries are used to make the code concise
