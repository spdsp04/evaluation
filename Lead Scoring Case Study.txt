# Lead Scoring Case Study


most of the irrelevant columns are dropped  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. . . . . . 

all the columns with level 'Select' have been identified and an appropriate action has been taken for each of them.

all of such columns have been dropped . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ... . .. .

the step has been done correctly until there are zero missing values in the data frame.

the rows retained are 60-70%. . . . . . . . .. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .

the dummy variables for all categorical variables have been created
the original columns are dropped.

both Scaling and Test-train split steps have been done. . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 

You have used RFE as the first step to select 15-20 variables.
the p-values are used appropriately to drop all the redundant variables.
the VIFs are used appropriately to drop all the redundant variables.

You have predicted the probabilities appropriately

You have successfully identified the optimal cutoff point
the optimal cutoff point is between required range.

You have successfully predicted the classes based on the optimal cutoff

all of these metrics are greater than required values.
the metrics are within close range to each other.

The test set has been scaled and predictions have been made on the test set
all of these metrics are greater than required values.
the metrics are within close range to each other.

You have correctly identified top three variables from your model

You have identified the top three categorical variables from your model correctly

the answer is largely correct . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .

the answer is largely correct . .. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .. .

Presentation is concise and well structured . . . . . . . . ... . . . . . . . . .. . . .. .

the recommendations make sense and relatable  to ground reality. . . . . .

the report is well written, report explains what was done in the case study clearly and concisely.

Code readability is good with appropriate indentations, comments are used and code is concise
