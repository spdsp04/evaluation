1) Data understanding, preparation, and feature engineering

1.1 All important data quality checks are performed and inconsistent/missing data is handled appropriately.

You have correctly identified numeric columns and categorical columns
You have identified number/or percentage of missing values.
You have imputed missing values as required.



2)  EDA and Feature Engineering



2.1 feature engineering

You have derived features as required.

2.2 EDA and plots

You have done univariate analysis and bivariate analysis using plots and summary tables. 



3)  Model selection, model building, evaluation & prediction



3.1  Data sampling

You have properly divided the data into training and testing set and maintained.

3.2 Preprocessing

You have scaled (numeric variables) and created dummy variables (for categorical variables)

3.3 Dimensionality reduction
