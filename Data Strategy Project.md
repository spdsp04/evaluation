# Data Strategy Project

1. 1. Solution for each use cases is correctly identified

In your solution, you have mentioned the right ML technique with the right key words for Sentiment Analysis, Customer Churn, Customer Acquisition Cost Optimization, Fraud Detection and Price Optimization. . . . 


A non ML solution is presented and explained. . . .. . . . . . .

Benefits have been clearly identified and the calculations are logical.

The right risks for the particular use case have been identified.  . . . .. . . . .. . .. .. . .

Success metrics identified are corresponding the ML technique identified earlier, and the metrics also include business relevant metrics as well.


framework is used to rate the use case and detailed and logical explanations are provided . . . .

framework is used to rate the use case and detailed and logical explanations are provided for each rating.. . . .. ..

Framework is used all the direct and indirect costs are considered. And the unit for all evaluations is the same. .. . . 

A project Roadmap is defined using the ratings obtained from the prioritisation framework, and also considers red flags planted when the use case was analysed.


no plagiarism is found . . . . . . .  .. . .

the documents are error free easy to understand the concisely written.

write up attached to each use case demonstrates a clear understanding of the solution. Points mentioned earlier evaluated specific portions of the use case, use this point to evaluate the entire solution as a whole.

the plot is easy to understand and reflects the same relative position of use cases as in the prioritization framework.

the matrix is readable and highlights the key points.

the roadmap is clearly communicated with the necessary justification and the justification is logical, and consistent with the framework
