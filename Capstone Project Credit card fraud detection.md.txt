You have observed the different feature type present in the data and plotted the distribution of classes.

You have correctly identified and removed useless variable(Time) by plotting scatter plots to observe the distribution of time & amount with class.


You have not performed train & test split using stratified split.

refer code for this code

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Perform stratified train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y)


you have checked if there is any skewness in the data and tried to mitigate it using Power transformer.


You have build more than 3 models and has done GridSearch/Randomised searchCV to arrive at ideal set of parameters. 


You have applied the best set of hyperparameters on the model to predict on the test dataset using the best evaluation metric


You have handled the class imbalances using at least two of the techniques to balance both train and test datasets.


You have build more than 3 models on each sampling technique and has done GridSearch/Randomised searchCV to arrive at ideal set of parameters. 


You have applied the best set of hyperparameters on the model to predict on the test dataset using the best evaluation metric 


the best model has an AUC score between 95-100 


the code is decently readable and well-commented 


appropriate libraries are used to make the code concise (rather than using long, verbose code)
